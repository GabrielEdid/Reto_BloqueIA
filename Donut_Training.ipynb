    "# Donut: Document Understanding Transformer for Structured Receipt Information Extraction\n",
    "---\n",
    "Donut (Document Understanding Transformer) is a vision-language model that specialized in extracting structured JSON outputs containing key-value pairs, which makes it good for parsing receipts into organized data formats. It direclty converts documents images into structured text, eliminating any kind of errors that might occur during the pipeline process on other systems. Extracting structured information from receipts is very challenging because they can have different layouts with different store formats and receipt designs, as well as other information, such as sotre details, iterm with prices, subtotals, and totals. Also, the model to extract the text needs to understand semantic differences that distinguishes between similar numbers, like item price vs total, missing fields, formatting variations, and more. Because of all this, using Donut is beneficial, since:\n",
    "- It is pre-trained on large-scale documents, which gives the ability to understand document structure from millions of images.\n",
    "- Generated structured JSON output directly, which is perfect for dtatabase storage and downstream applications.\n",
    "- It contains multi-modal undrstanding that combines visual layout and text semantics.\n",
    "- We can apply transfer learning to leverage knowledge from divese document types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Donut follows an encoder-decoder architecture where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encoder: Swin Transformer**:\n",
    "    - **Input**: Receipt an RGB image and resized to fixed dimensions.\n",
    "    - **Process**: The image is divided into patches using hierarchical windows, creating multi-scale feature representations\n",
    "    - **Output**: Sequence of visual embeddings representing document structure and content\n",
    "    - **Pre-trained on**: ImageNet-22K and document images\n",
    "    - **What it does**: It extracts visual features, while preserving spatial relationships and hierarchical document structure\n",
    "2. **Decoder: mBART (Multilingual BART)**:\n",
    "    - **Input**: Visual embeddings from encoder and task prompt `<s_cord-v2>`\n",
    "    - **Process**: Generates JSON tokens autoregressively (one character at a time)\n",
    "    - **Output**: Structured JSON string containing receipt information\n",
    "    - **Pre-trained on**: Large multilingual text corpora\n",
    "    - **What it does**: Converts visual features into structured JSON using sequence-to-sequence generation. It is very robust to receipt variations, such as different layouts, fonts, and quality.\n",
    "    - It uses mBART since it has a strong multilingual capabilities and can handle various receipt languages, robust JSON generation trained on structured text formats, and contextual understanding to maintain valid JSON structure throughout generation. It also gives a high accuracy on structured information extraction\n",
    "3. **Cross-Attention Mechanism**: the decoder attends to encoder outputs at each generation step, and applying fine-tuning allows us to: \n",
    "    - Focus on specific document regions when generating each JSON key-value pair\n",
    "    - Align visual features with semantic labels. An alternative is to use `naver-clova-ix/donut-base-finetuned-cord-v2`, which is already fine-tuned on CORD-v2, but we want to compare our custom fine-tuning strategies.\n",
    "    - Handle variable document layouts and field positions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following steps, we are going to implement three fine-tuning strategies to adapt the pre-trained Donut model to receipt parsing:\n",
    "1. **Strategy 1: Frozen Encoder (Feature Extraction)**:\n",
    "    - **Freeze**: All encoder layers (Swin Transformer)\n",
    "    - **Train**: Only decoder layers (mBART)\n",
    "    - **Reason**: The encoder already knows how to extract visual features from documents, since it is pre-trained on document images. We only need to adapt the decoder to receipt-specific JSON structure and vocabulary.\n",
    "    - **Advantages**: Fast training, low memory usage, less chance of overfitting\n",
    "    - **Disadvantages**: Limited adaptation to receipt-specific visual patterns, such as thermal printing artifacts and variable quality.\n",
    "    - **Best for**: Small datasets and limited compute resources (Our dataset has 1000 receipts).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Strategy 2: Partial Unfreezing (Progressive Fine-Tuning)**:\n",
    "    - **Freeze**: First N-2 encoder layers\n",
    "    - **Train**: Last 2 encoder layers, as well as all decoder layers\n",
    "    - **Reason**: Lower Swin Transformer layers learn generic features, like edges and windows, while higher layers learn task-specific patterns. By unfreezing the last 2 layers, we allow the model to adapt to receipt-specific visual characteristics like tables and text regions.\n",
    "    - **Advantages**: Better domain adaptation than frozen encoder\n",
    "    - **Disadvantages**: Requires more memory and compute than Strategy 1\n",
    "    - **Best for**: Medium-sized datasets with some computational budget\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Strategy 3: Full Fine-Tuning (End-to-End Training)**:\n",
    "    - **Freeze**: Nothing\n",
    "    - **Train**: All encoder and decoder layers\n",
    "    - **Reason**: Maximum adaptation to receipts. The model can learn receipt-specific visual features and JSON generation patterns simultaneously.\n",
    "    - **Advantages**: Best performance potential, due to full customization\n",
    "    - **Disadvantages**: Requires large dataset, high memory/compute, but has risk of overfitting\n",
    "    - **Best for**: Large datasets and sufficient compute"

    "  - `category`: Semantic labels (menu.nm, menu.price, total.total_price, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Extraction Process**:\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to convert the structured JSON annotations into a format suitable for Donut's sequence-to-sequence generation. To achieve this, we will follow these steps:\n",
    "1. **Parse JSON**: Load the `ground_truth` string and parse it as JSON\n",
    "2. **Extract structured fields**: Iterate through `valid_line` and `words` to collect all text\n",
    "3. **Create JSON output**: Package extracted information as a JSON string with key-value pairs\n",
    "4. **Add task prompt**: Prepend `<s_cord-v2>` token to guide the decoder\n",

    "   - Input JSON: `{\"valid_line\": [{\"words\": [{\"text\": \"TOTAL\"}, {\"text\": \"$45.99\"}]}]}`\n",

    "1. Apply our custom transforms, which are minimal ColorJitter for subtle augmentation to avoid aggressive transforms that hurt OCR.\n",
    "2. Use Donut processor to handle resizing, normalization, and conversion to tensors internally.\n",
    "3. Apply tokenization to convert JSON strings into token IDs using mBART tokenizer.\n",
    "4. Put in padding or truncation sequences to a `max_length` of 512 tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some special cases include:\n",
    "- **Task prompt**: `<s_cord-v2>` is added as a special token to signal receipt parsing task\n",
    "- **Padding tokens**: Replaced with `-100` in labels so they're ignored during loss computation\n",
    "- **Max length**: Set to 512 tokens to accommodate structured JSON while fitting in GPU memory\n",

    "## Donut Model Implementation with PyTorch Lightning\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use PyTorch Lightning for the same reasons as TrOCR:\n",
    "- **Organized code**: Separates research code from engineering code\n",
    "- **Built-in features**: Automatic logging, checkpointing, early stopping, multi-GPU support\n",
    "- **Reproducibility**: Handles random seeds, deterministic training\n",
    "- **Less boilerplate**: No need to manually write training loops, GPU transfer logic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Class Structure**: The following implementation of our `DonutLightningModel` inherits from `LightningModule` and implements:\n",
    "1. Initialization (`__init__`):\n",
    "    - Load pre-trained `VisionEncoderDecoderModel` (Swin + mBART) from Hugging Face\n",
    "    - Load corresponding `DonutProcessor` to handle image preprocessing and tokenization.\n",
    "    - Add task-specific token `<s_cord-v2>` to vocabulary and resize decoder embeddings\n",
    "    - Configure generation parameters, like start token, padding, and EOS token.\n",
    "    - Apply freezing strategy (freeze/unfreeze layers based on strategy)\n",
    "    - Initialize metrics: token-level accuracy\n",
    "2. Freezing Strategy (`_apply_freezing_strategy`):\n",
    "    - Iterate through `model.encoder.parameters()` and set `requires_grad = False` to freeze\n",
    "    - For partial unfreezing: Access Swin layers via `model.encoder.encoder.layers[-N:]` and unfreeze\n",
    "    - Decoder is always trainable: `model.decoder.parameters()` have `requires_grad = True`\n",
    "    - We freeze parameters, since those don't compute gradients, which is equivalent to faster training and less memory. Also, pre-trained weights are preserved and only task-specific layers adapt for better generalization on small datasets.\n",
    "3. Forward Pass (`forward`):\n",
    "    - Takes `pixel_values` (image tensors) and `labels` (JSON token IDs)\n",
    "    - Returns model outputs including loss and logits\n",
    "    - Loss is automatically computed by comparing logits with labels (cross-entropy)\n",
    "4. Training Step (`training_step`):\n",
    "    - This is what happens in each training iteration:\n",
    "        1. Forward pass: `outputs = self(pixel_values, labels=labels)`\n",
    "        2. Extract loss: `loss = outputs.loss`\n",
    "        3. Compute token-level accuracy from logits (no generation during training for efficiency)\n",
    "        4. Log metrics: `self.log('train_loss', loss)`, `self.log('train_acc', self.train_acc)`\n",
    "        5. Return loss (Lightning automatically calls `loss.backward()` and optimizer step)\n",
    "    - Computing accuracy from logits is much faster than generating full JSON sequences\n",
    "5. Validation Step (`validation_step`):\n",
    "    - Evaluate model on validation set to monitor overfitting\n",
    "        1. Forward pass, same as training.\n",
    "        2. Compute token-level accuracy from logits\n",
    "        3. Log metrics: `self.log('val_loss', loss)`, `self.log('val_acc', self.val_acc)`\n",
    "    - No JSON generation during validation for speed (only during test)\n",
    "6. Test Step (`test_step`):\n",
    "    - Generate full JSON sequences for qualitative evaluation\n",
    "        1. Forward pass for loss and accuracy\n",
    "        2. Generate predictions: `model.generate(pixel_values, max_length=512)`\n",
    "        3. Decode predictions to JSON strings\n",
    "        4. Compute token-level accuracy\n",
    "        5. Log metrics and return predictions for analysis\n",
    "7. Optimizer Configuration (`configure_optimizers`)\n",
    "    - AdamW Optimizer:\n",
    "        - Variant of Adam with decoupled weight decay to prevent overfitting\n",
    "        - Learning rate: 5e-5, which is commonly used for fine-tuning document understanding models\n",
    "        - Weight decay: 0.01, which is L2 regularization.\n",
    "    - Cosine Annealing with Warmup:\n",
    "        - Gradually increases LR during warmup (500 steps)\n",
    "        - Then decreases following cosine schedule\n",
    "        - Helps model converge smoothly and avoid early training instability\n",
    "\n",
    "Some key variables are:\n",
    "1. `max_length=512`: limit inference time and memory usage while accommodating structured JSON outputs. We decided on 512, since JSON outputs are typically longer than plain text.\n",
    "2. We replace padding with `-100` in labels, since PyTorch's `CrossEntropyLoss` ignores index `-100`, which ensures padding tokens don't contribute to loss and prevents the model from learning to predict padding.\n",
    "3. We have log metrics with `prog_bar=True` to display metrics in real-time during training, which helps us monitor training progress.\n",
    "4. `<s_cord-v2>` task prompt: guides the decoder to generate receipt-specific JSON structure\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation follows best practices for fine-tuning vision-language models and provides a clean, maintainable codebase for experimentation with structured document understanding."

    "## Donut DataModule with Custom Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will implement a `LightningDataModule` to encapsulate all data-related logic in one place, such as:\n",
    "- Dataset creation (train/val/test splits)\n",
    "- Data transformations and augmentations\n",
    "- DataLoader configuration, like batch size, shuffling and workers.\n",
    "- Reproducibility to ensure consistent data handling across experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "To not rely only on Donut processor, we use our custom preprocessing first:\n",
    "- **Minimal ColorJitter**: subtle brightness and contrast adjustments to avoid aggressive transforms that hurt OCR performance.\n",
    "- Applying first our custom transform is very important because it improves the image quality of the receipts without introducing artifacts. Then, using Donut Processor helps us resize, normalize and convert to tensor with the purpose of preparing for model input.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Augmentation Strategy**: \n",
    "- Training step: we will apply minimal augmentations to slightly increase dataset diversity.\n",
    "    - Color jitter with 0.05 brightness and contrast to simulate subtle lightning variations.\n",
    "    - No rotation or geometric transforms, since these can hurt document understanding performance.\n",
    "- Validation and Test sets: no augmentation, only processor normalization.\n",
    "    - We want to measure true performance on clean, processed images.\n",
    "    - Augmentation during validation would give misleading metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DataLoader Configuration**:\n",
    "- **Batch size**: Set to 4 for frozen strategy, 2 for partial and full\n",
    "- **Shuffle**: True for training for random order, but False for validation and test\n",
    "- **num_workers**: Set to 4 for parallel data loading\n",

    "2. Stacks `labels` tensors into batch: `torch.stack([item['labels'] for item in batch])`\n",
    "3. Keeps target_sequence as list: `[item['target_sequence'] for item in batch]` (used for debugging and analysis)\n",

    "Now, we'll implement the second strategy for Donut model. Here, we'll unfreeze the last 2 Swin Transformer layers, while keeping the rest frozen. This allows the model to adapt higher-level visual features to receipt-specific document patterns, such as table structures, receipt headers, itemized lists, and price alignments, while preserving the low-level feature extraction learned from pre-training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Changes compared to Strategy 1**:\n",
    "- **Trainable parameters**: 80M (decoder + last 2 Swin layers)\n",
    "- **Frozen parameters**: 69M (first Swin layers)\n",
    "- **Epochs**: 25, 5 fewer epochs since it should take longer per epoch\n",
    "- **Batch size**: 2, reduced due to memory constraints with more trainable params\n",
    "- **Training time**: approximately 7-9 hours because it's slower than Strategy 1 due to more layers to train\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose this approach because:\n",
    "- The lower Swin Transformer layers learn generic visual features like edges, patches, and basic textures, that's why we keep them frozen.\n",
    "- The higher Swin layers learn document-specific hierarchical patterns, that's why we unfreeze to adapt the model for receipt structure understanding.\n",
    "- Balances domain adaptation with training efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the configuration remains the same, in terms of gradient accumulation (8 steps for effective batch 16), learning rate (5e-5), precision (FP16), callbacks (ModelCheckpoint, EarlyStopping, CSVLogger).\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected results of this strategy, based on CORD-v2 benchmarks, are:\n",
    "- **Val loss**: 0.15-0.4, which is lower than Strategy 1\n",
    "- **Token accuracy**: 92-96%, which is better than Strategy 1\n",
